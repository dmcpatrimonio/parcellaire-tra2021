  abstract = {The political instability lived in Portugal during the transition of the 19thcentury to the 20th century, strongly contributed to the shielding of Portugalfrom international influences and to the need of a National Identity.Yet, was born in Portugal - by the hand of those who looked in modernarchitecture for a solution to the new architectural and social programs - anarchitecture of inevitable modernity that searched a new path towards anational architecture.The railroad architecture of the beginning of the 20th century is, in thisway, product of a sifting of international styles and ideologies, and of adouble filter between Europe and Portugal, and Portugal and the PortugueseRailroad Company. This would result in a mixed architecture, with ahybrid character, somewhere between the ideology of the Casa Portuguesa(Portuguese House) and the modern programs.Essentially born from a straight connection with the railroad, the city ofEntroncamento doesn't show great architecture. In spite, it is an enormousfield of experimentation for the new architectural doctrines and for thespacial utopias that marked the end of the Portuguese and European 19thcentury and the beginning of the 20th century.This work is about these experiences that focused mainly on the housingcrisis and in the search of its solution.},

  abstract = {This article aims to investigate the relationship between the architecture produced during the Pereira Passos administration and the preexisting architecture in the central area of Rio de Janeiro. The discourses that justified the urban reforms of the Passos period built this relationship in terms of the antinomy between the “old” and the “new”, creating the idea that an ancient colonial city, with narrow alleyways and insalubrious, artless houses, would be completely replaced by a radiant city endowed with wide avenues for air and traffic circulation, and flanked by hygienic buildings with a renewed architectural language. However, this powerful image of a total renovation of the city turned out to be schematic, in the sense that it did not encompass the complexity of the relationship between the new architecture and the pre-existing one – a relationship visible in the allotment of the land, in the building techniques employed, in the architectonic scale of the new real estate, in its functions and even in the countless renovations of existing buildings, some of which were from the same colonial period diminished in the discourse that justified the building works.},

  abstract = {The main focus of this research is to investigate both the development of new urban structures caused by the rapid expansion of cities as well as traditional structures of the historic city of Ouro Preto, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, through the application of methodologies developed by Urban Morphology schools. The dilemma between tradition and modernity is a recurrent theme, especially in the colonial towns of Minas Gerais. These towns contain a historic core that must be preserved, thus proposed expansions must be concerned with maintaining the quality of the citys historic centre landscape: its buildings, its urban fabric, and its morphotypological characteristics. Over the years, the landscape quality of Ouro Pretos historic centre has not been respected nor even taken into consideration as a basis for future interventions or the drafting of urban plans. The lack of dialogue among the various urban structures leads to a loss of the citys historical character as a whole. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the urban landscape, the city development and renewal can not be stopped. However, growth of the urban environment must guided in a balanced manner so that the economic interests of some social classes do not outweigh community interests. Through this study, we hope to contribute to research on the topic of urban morphology, as well as to the quality of the landscape, since research on this subject can aid in the decision-making process regarding the conservation of historic urban centres.},
